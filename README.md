## Project overview

* The main focus of this project required a demonstration of understanding JQuery. A user visits this page and is able to:
** See today's date inside the heading
** See hours 8 AM - 5 PM
** Add/delete text to each appointment slot
** Save individual appointments
** Refresh page and appointments persist

## Psuedo code

* I did some psuedo coding when it came to the layout. I started by writing the html - one row with three columns x total hours. I then worked with jQuery to build the code and had to debug quite a bit before finally landing on working code. Parent/child relationships were key in this part of the assignment.

## Building the code & JQuery

* The two most challenging portions of the page were:
    * past/present/future code
    * display appointment from lS in the right hour column

## What I'm proud of most

* I am so proud of myself for being able to write the html needed and then working with jQuery to get to the same result. I am also proud of myself for establishing one array to keep track of data vs splitting them apart. I'm proud of establishing a relationship between 3 PM & 15 to solve for several assignment requirements.

* I appreciate the reduced amount of formatting this assignment needed. Instead, my focus was the backend and functionality built where the eye cannot see.

* Line 100 of my script.js was probably the most eye-opening. My mind knew what was needed but I had yet to use/interact with .eq and _ in code. I'd scoured internet sites and articles but I wasn't searching for the right information. Partnering with a peer helped bring together what I'd not yet known how to-do.

## Future state

* With more time I plan to add: 
    * Validation against null input field
    * "I'm going on vacation, clear my calendar" button
    * Code that clears LS if savedAppt are in the past
