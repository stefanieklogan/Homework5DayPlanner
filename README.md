## Project overview

* The main focus of this project required a demonstration of understanding JQuery. A user visits this page and is able to:
* See today's date inside the heading
* See hours 8 AM - 6 PM
* Add/delete text to each hour/appointment slot

## Psuedo code

* I did some psuedo coding when it came to the layout. I started by proving to myself that I knew what html would be needed as an end product - one row with three columns x total hours. I then worked with jQuery to build the code and had to debug quite a bit before finally landing on working code. Parent/child relationships were key in this part of the assignment.

## Building the code & Java

* Is there a world record for the highest # of var in a js file? My biggest file to-date and probably only a fraction of the code I'll be writing 30 days from now. I am still working on writing small snippets of code, testing, committing and moving on. I find I'll write 5-10 lines and then debug for awhile.

## What I'm proud of most

* I am so proud of myself for being able to write the html needed and then working with jQuery to get to the same result. I am also proud of myself for figuring out the hourArr and putting a relationship between 3 PM & 15 to solve for assignment requirements. 

* I appreciate the reduced amount of formatting this assignment needed. Instead, my focus was the backend and functionality built where the eye cannot see.
